<h2> The <strong><em>PARASOL</em></strong> is not the same as an umbrella </h2>
   
<div class="parag">
  
    <p>Both parasols and umbrellas are personal portable devices to shield oneself from either the sun (<em>parasol</em>) or inclement weather like the rain (<em>umbrella</em>). Basically, this personal item is a long shaft with mounted ribs that is covered with a suitable material and when opened, by pushing up a runner stretching-out the ribs, it unfolds into a semi-circle. Thus, you now have a personal canopy, and when done, it is folded down back to its vertical shaft. </p>

    <p> <strong><em>Parasol</em></strong> is from the French – para ("to shield") and sol ("the sun"). Although embraced in the mid-1600s by the French, and also, the English – most likely from contact with the Chinese – the term for this personal device has stuck ever since. Parasols have been part of the fabric of art, as seen in <strong>Claude Monet's</strong> 1875 painting, <strong><em>Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son </em></strong> and<strong> Suzuki Harunobu's </strong> 1750 Egoyomi (woodblock print).</p>

    <p>In fact, the parasol's origins go far as back to the ancient Assyrians where in the city of Nineveh (abandoned in 612 BCE) it is depicted in many sculptures, as well as in ancient Egypt, Greece and China. Its primarily use then, as is today, is to shield us from the strong daylight; and for some, as decorative objects, such as paper parasols adorning cocktails. </p>
