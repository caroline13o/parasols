   <h2> The <strong><em>PARASOL</em></strong> is not the same as an umbrella. </h2>
   
    <div id="p">
  
        <p>Both parasols and umbrellas are personal portable devices to shield oneself from either the sun (<em>parasol</em>) or inclement weather, like the rain (<em>umbrella</em>). Basically, these personal items have handles with mounted ribs covered by a suitable material. It can be opened by pushing up a runner, stretching-out the ribs into a semi-circle; when done it is folded down to a vertical shaft. </p>

        Parasol is from the French – para ("to shield") and sol ("the sun"). The parasol's origins go far as back to the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh (abandoned in 612 BCE) where it is depicted in many sculptures, as well as to ancient Egypt, Greece and China. Its primarily use then, as is today: to shield us from the strong daylight and as decorative objects. </p>
        
        <p>Parasols have been part of the fabric of art, like Claude Monet's 1875 painting, <em>Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son</em>.</p>
